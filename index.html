          My name is Aaron, and I am a 4th-year student studying computer
          science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am
          pursuing my bachelors and masters degrees in computer science here 
          at WPI, both of which I will be obtaining in May 2022.

        Besides being a CS major at WPI, I'm the web secretary of the computer 
        science honor society Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the treasurer of the Greenhouse 
        and Horticulture Club and a member of WPI's "Data Driven Materials Science," 
        a joint computer/data science and materials science research team studying
        creating data science solutions for materials science problems. I'm also a 
        student assistant, where I help students with computer science classes.

        Outside of school, I like playing basketball, cooking, playing video
        games, the outdoors, and coding in my free time. I also worked at
        theCoderSchool in Sudbury, MA where I taught kids of many ages to code in
        languages like JavaScript, Python, and Scratch.

        In the summer of 2020 (the summer of my sophomore year), I worked at
        MathWorks in Natick, MA as a software engineering intern. MathWorks is 
        best known for their main product MATLAB, and I worked on the Release 
        Engineering team. In this role, I used MathWorks' internal continuous 
        integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools to make sure that 
        MATLAB, Simulink, and other products built and tested without failures. 
        This gave me a great opportunity to work outside of my comfort zone and 
        learn a lot about the software development lifecycle. I also worked 
        with SQL and Perl to create an internal tool that the Release Engineering
        team will continue to use after my summer was over.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2021, I returned to MathWorks as a software engineering
        intern. This time around, I worked with the Data Science Types development 
        team. My main project was working to improve MATLAB's tabular display by
        truncating large tables. I went through the full software engineering design 
        process, and eventually presented my work to several experienced MathWorks 
        developers and managers. This significantly improved performance of tabular
        display, and will likely impact the many users who work with tables. Another
        project I worked on involved utilizing new C++ functionality to improve
        the performance of MATLAB functions that are written in C++. This showed
        potential to reduce bottlenecks in functions, and resulted in significantly
        reduced calling overhead in many cases.
